# rnd blocks

Finding hidden treasures in the unicode character set is a hobby of mine. I've found [Braille Characters](https://github.com/lejeunerenard/braille-from-image) and various [geometric symbols](https://instagram.com/p/55_Ha_BWRk/) which I like to use in [instagram](https://instagram.com/p/7RDZH1hWdL/?taken-by=lejeunerenard) [titles](https://instagram.com/p/8tyB92hWTj).

Once I stubbled upon [block elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements), it just felt natural to create grids. Line after line filling the screen with each character periodically set to a random block. And from this chaotic chorus, patterns emerged. Caravans of of blocks heading left. Blink. Now they're flowing down. Negative space spinning clockwise, then counter clockwise. Ants crawling in diagonal patterns.

How was I seeing meaning out of the chaos? ... Apophenia.

Apophenia, 'the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data' as defined by [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia), is powered by the pattern recognizer 9000, AKA the brain, trying it's best to tame the wilderness of random number generators. By physically ( or mentally ) shifting my perception I could find new interpretations of what I was seeing. Even as I write this, I am devising new patterns to explain its movement.

[Holo Magazine](http://holo-magazine.com/)'s first cover contributed to my fascination with blocks. When I saw the block unicode characters, I thought "those look just like the cover of HOLO".
